# One or more Alfred (MacOS) workflows. 

## 'Vind een Obsidian file'
This workflow lets you search for a file within your Obsidian vault through the filesystem (you need to set the file filter scope to your vault's folder).
Default it will turn the file name into a wikilink (turning filepath/name.md into [[name]]) and put that on your clipboard.
I use this during annotating using hypothes.is of webarticles in my browser, where I sometimes search for Obsidian files to link to in my annotations.
Cmd enter will open the file in a text editor.
Alt enter will reveal the file in Finder.
